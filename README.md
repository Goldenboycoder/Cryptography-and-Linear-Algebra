# Cryptography-and-Linear-Algebra
Author : Patrick Balian 
As a student, i have been asked to make a program that demonstrates encryption basics and how we use linear algebra in it .
How to use :
1- The program will ask you to input a String to be Encrypted
2- The program will ask you if you want to Encrypt (you should first Encrypt)
3-You will get then the encrypted matrix along with the cypher(key)
4-Then you will have the option to Decrypt with the inverse of the cypher matrix (option 2)
5- You will obtain the inverse cypher matrix along with the text you first Entered at the beginning of the program
6-you can choose (3) to test our Hash like encryption algorithm
7-the program will ask you to login to "your account" we already set the password before hand on line(212)

I Hope my project will help you in some way or at least it will clarify encryption basics  .
